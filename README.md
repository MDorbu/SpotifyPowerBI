## Takeaways
Artists that have pop-related music are most likely to chart more than once. Pop-related genres comprised over 80 percent of charting songs from 2010 to 2019. One-hit wonders only make up 12 percent of charting songs over this period. Approximately 37 percent of artists with songs designated as top Spotify songs had 2 to 5 songs chart over this period.
